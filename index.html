						I am a Mandarin and Spanish tutor and have been tutoring
						for over five years now. After completing my Masters in
						Business Administration with a major in Marketing, I
						cleared my advanced level examinations in Mandarin and
						became a qualified professional tutor in the language.
						Thereafter, I have had the experience of teaching
						Mandarin and Spanish to several students and employees
						at various corporations across the globe. After such an
						enriching experience, I have become well-adept at
						understanding the requirements of students and providing
						a tailor-made teaching experience based on their needs.
						With my perfect blend of business knowledge and language
						proficiency, I ensure that my students get the best
						learning experience.

							My daughter Thwisha takes Mandarin classes from
							Rashi and she is really happy with the way the
							classes are conducted.
						</p>

						<p>
							Rashi is very good with Mandarin characters and
							pronunciation. Also, Thwisha is very comfortable
							speaking to her regarding her doubts and queries and
							has never had any complaints in Mandarin. She is
							also guiding Thwisha for Mandarin international
							exams.

							I would highly recommend Rashi if anyone wants to

							It was indeed an excellent experience of learning
							the Spanish language from you. You have taught me
							with so much of dedication. You were always on time
							for the class and ensured I learnt the vocabulary
							and grammar well and have done the homework before
							proceeding for next class.
						</p>

						<p>
							You supported me a lot for my Dele A1 exam, not only
							by taking extra classes to bring me up to that
							proficiency level to give the exam, but also by
							giving me training on speaking and listening skills.
						</p>

						<p>
							You are a truly hardworking teacher and I am very
							very thankful to you. Awaiting to start Mandarin
							from month of August. Thanks once again!
